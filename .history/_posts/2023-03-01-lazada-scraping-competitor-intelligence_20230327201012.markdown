-	Scraped (Selenium) 4000+ Lazada product pages of clients, their competitors, and similar recommended products
-	Derived insight on comparative prices, discounts, & ratings across similar items. Assessed text similarity between the clients’ products and similar items using SpaCy, to find and report suspected “copy-cat” posts
