# Kevin Jeswani - Data Science Projects

# [Project 1: Big Twitter Topic Modelling (Clustering) & Sentiment (Classification)](https://github.com/kevinjeswani/BigTwitter_Clustering-Classification)
-	Streamed tweets into AWS S3 with Kinesis Firehose and combined it with a larger 55 mil.-tweet dataset *(Not covered in this repo)*
-	Utilized PySpark in DataBricks to build custom PySpark transformers, label sentiment with SparkNLP/VADER, explore SparkML RandomForest and Logistic Regression classifiers, and to perform Latent Drichlet Allocation topic modelling
-	Visualized results in AWS QuickSight through an Athena pipeline

# [Project 4: Regression Analysis of Deaths due to Environmental Factors](https://github.com/kevinjeswani/Environmental_Factor_Deaths)
o	Fuzzy-joining of various datasets on deaths due to environmental factors and global macroeconomic indicators
o	Utilized Auto-ML (PyCaret) for regressor model selection and preliminary hyperparameter selection
o	Hyperparamter tuning, auto-encoding, cross-validation, & ensembling of RandomForest, Extra Tree, and XGBoost
