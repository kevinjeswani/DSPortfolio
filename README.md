# [Project 1: Big Twitter Topic Modelling (Clustering) & Sentiment (Classification)](https://github.com/kevinjeswani/BigTwitter_Clustering-Classification)
Topic modelling and sentiment analysis on big twitter data (4-55mil. tweets)
-	Streamed tweets into AWS S3 with Kinesis Firehose and combined it with a larger 55 mil.-tweet dataset *(Not covered in this repo)*
-	Utilized PySpark in DataBricks to build custom PySpark transformers, label sentiment with SparkNLP/VADER, explore SparkML RandomForest and Logistic Regression classifiers, and to perform Latent Drichlet Allocation topic modelling
-	Visualized results in AWS QuickSight through an Athena pipeline
